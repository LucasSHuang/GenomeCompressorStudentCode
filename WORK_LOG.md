| Nov 18  | 7:30-8:15pm | I completed the problem set. One of the problems I had during the problem set was that after I thought I finished there was an error were pretty much everthing in the result was all 'A'. I realized that this was because I didn't specify how many bits that the code should compress into for the binary so it was just becoming 32 bits instead of 2. I changed that and then it worked. |
